# Sorting-algorithms-time-calculator
The full task description follows:

## FIRST PART
 a) Use test vectors of size 62,500, 125,000, 250,000, 375,000 with random values integers. It is important to emphasize that the same vector must be used in tests with each one of the two algorithms.
 
 b) For each vector size:
 
 I. create 50 randomly filled vectors;
 
 II. perform a sorting using each of the two algorithms;
 
 III. mark the execution time and calculate the average of this time for each method.
 
 c) Create a table comparing the time x size results between the two algorithms.

## SECOND PART
a) Using the vector of size 10,000, perform a comparison of the quicksort algorithm with a random vector and another already ordered. Run this test 10 times to get the average
time;
